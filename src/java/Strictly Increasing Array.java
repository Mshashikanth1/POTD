Strictly Increasing Array
HardAccuracy: 31.82%Submissions: 12K+Points: 8
Given an array nums of n positive integers. Find the minimum number of operations required to modify the array such that array elements are in strictly increasing order (nums[i] < nums[i+1]).
Changing a number to greater or lesser than original number is counted as one operation.

Note: Array elements can become negative after applying operation.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 6
nums = [1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4]
Output: 
2
Explanation: 
By decreasing 6 by 2 and increasing 4 by 2, nums will be like [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] which is stricly increasing.
Example 2:

Input: 
n = 4
nums = [1, 1, 1, 1]
Output: 
3
Explanation: 
One such array after operation can be [-2, -1, 0, 1]. We require atleast 3 operations for this example.
Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function min_opeartions() which takes the array nums as input parameter and returns the minimum number of opeartion needed to make the array strictly increasing.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n2)
Expected Space Complexity: O(n)

Constraints: 
1 <= n <= 103
1 <= nums[i] <= 109
