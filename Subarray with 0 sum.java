Given an array of integers. Find if there is a subarray (of size at-least one) with 0 sum. You just need to return true/false depending upon whether there is a subarray present with 0-sum or not. Printing will be taken care by the driver code.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 5
arr = {4,2,-3,1,6}
Output: 
Yes
Explanation: 
2, -3, 1 is the subarray with sum 0.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 5
arr = {4,2,0,1,6}
Output: 
Yes
Explanation: 
0 is one of the element in the array so there exist a subarray with sum 0.
Your Task:
You only need to complete the function subArrayExists() that takes array and n as parameters and returns true or false.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n).

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 104
-105 <= a[i] <= 105
